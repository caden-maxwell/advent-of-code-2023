# Advent of Code 2023 Challenge

Welcome to my [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) repo! Here, I share my solutions to the daily coding challenges from the 2023 Advent of Code challenge.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a platform for honing my programming skills and exploring new languages. Each day, I approach the challenges using a different programming language, providing for a diverse set of solutions and a great opportunity to learn. I hope you enjoy following along!

## Structure

- Each day's solutions are organized into separate folders: `01`, `02`, `03`, etc.
- Solutions for each day are written in a different programming language, whether it's an old favorite or one I've never heard of.
- Each solution is accompanied by a `README.md` file, including:
    - A brief description of the problem
    - My approach to the solution
    - Any build/run instructions
